# Pizza Menu

This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings.  It takes the information input by the user and calculates a total price for the order.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is the classic game of tic-tac-toe.  The user and computer alternate turns as the computer chooses it's square randomly.  Different music is played when the user chooses their square and on a tie or a win.

# Calculator
This is a basic 4 function calculator.  Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a web version of a calculator.
